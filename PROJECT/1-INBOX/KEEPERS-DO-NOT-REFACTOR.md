Well-architected/code strengths

Scoped capabilities & conditional loading: Enqueues JS only for users with activate_plugins and derives page context to limit heavy work to plugins/cache pages, reducing attack surface and overhead KISS-quick-search.php:60-134.
Cache versioning & migration: Uses CACHE_VERSION, TTL, and migration off legacy localStorage to sessionStorage to limit persistence and fingerprinting risk, with guard rails on read/write and corruption handling plugin-quick-search.js:4-160.
Debounced, tiered search pipeline: Clear separation of fast passes (exact/prefix/contains) before fuzzy, with incremental filtering and capped result set for perf; debounced input and cached query results reduce per-keystroke cost plugin-quick-search.js:236-365.
Optimized render path: Builds result HTML in memory once per search, applies a single DOM update, and adds match-type styling only once, minimizing layout thrash plugin-quick-search.js:1200-1330.
User-centric UX touches: Keyboard-first control, Shift+Enter to settings, highlight/scroll to selected plugin, cached placeholder counts, and cache rebuild hotkey show thoughtful operator experience design plugin-quick-search.js:720-870.
Cache invalidation on lifecycle events: Server side deletes transient plugin counts on activate/deactivate/delete/upgrade, and client side verifies integrity/staleness before reuse—pragmatic hygiene for cached inventories KISS-quick-search.php:52-58 and plugin-quick-search.js:400-518.
Extensibility hooks & diagnostics: Exposes window.PQS API, custom events (pqs-cache-rebuilt, pqs-cache-status-changed), and a self-test panel for cache/search/system checks, aiding integration and maintenance plugin-quick-search.js:20-120 and KISS-quick-search.php:833-1187.
Defense-in-depth details: Input sanitization (sanitizeInput), HTML escaping for rendered text, admin-context checks before cache access, and avoidance of DOM elements in cached payloads to limit leakage and XSS surfaces plugin-quick-search.js:540-620.
If you want a short list of “keepers” to double down on: the tiered search + render pipeline, the capability-scoped loading, the cache version/TTL discipline with sessionStorage, and the public event/API surface for integrations.
