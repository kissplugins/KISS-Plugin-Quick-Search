Looking at your Plugin Quick Search code, I can identify several performance bottlenecks that are causing the laggy typing experience:

## Main Performance Issues

### 1. **Inefficient Levenshtein Distance Calculation**
The biggest culprit is the Levenshtein distance algorithm running on **every plugin** for **every keystroke**. This creates a quadratic time complexity problem:
- For each character typed, it runs on all plugins
- The algorithm itself is O(mÃ—n) where m and n are string lengths
- With 500+ plugins, this becomes exponentially expensive

**Fix:** Only run fuzzy matching as a fallback when exact/partial matches are insufficient.

### 2. **Excessive DOM Manipulation**
Even with the "optimized" approach, you're still rebuilding the entire results HTML on every keystroke:
- String concatenation in a loop
- Full innerHTML replacement
- Re-applying event handlers

**Fix:** Implement virtual scrolling or result recycling - only update changed items.

### 3. **Redundant Search Operations**
The debouncing helps, but the search algorithm still does unnecessary work:
- Recalculating scores for plugins that haven't changed position significantly
- Re-sorting the entire array every time
- Processing plugins that clearly won't match

**Fix:** Implement incremental search - when adding characters, filter from previous results instead of starting fresh.

### 4. **Memory Allocation Overhead**
Creating new objects and arrays constantly:
```javascript
const scoredPlugins = matchingPlugins.map(plugin => ({
    ...plugin,
    score: calculateRelevanceScore(plugin, lowerQuery)
}));
```

**Fix:** Reuse objects and use in-place sorting with a separate scores array.

## Recommended Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
1. **Increase debounce delay** to 250-300ms (typing feel vs responsiveness trade-off) - **Status: Done**
2. **Lazy fuzzy matching** - only run Levenshtein when simple string matching yields <5 results - **Status: Done**
3. **Early result limiting** - stop processing after finding 20 good matches - **Status: Done**

### Phase 2: Algorithmic Improvements
1. **Incremental filtering** - when query gets longer, filter from previous results - **Status: Done**
2. **Tiered search strategy**: - **Status: Done**
   - First pass: exact matches only
   - Second pass: prefix matches
   - Third pass: contains matches
   - Final pass: fuzzy matching (only if needed)

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations
1. **Virtual scrolling** for the results list
2. **Web Workers** for fuzzy matching calculations
3. **Trie data structure** for prefix matching
4. **Result recycling** instead of full DOM rebuilds

## Expected Performance Impact
- **Current**: ~200-500ms lag on large plugin lists
- **After Phase 1**: ~50-100ms lag
- **After Phase 2**: ~20-50ms lag  
- **After Phase 3**: <20ms lag (near-instant)

The most impactful change would be eliminating the per-keystroke Levenshtein calculations and implementing smarter result filtering. This alone should make it feel significantly more responsive.
