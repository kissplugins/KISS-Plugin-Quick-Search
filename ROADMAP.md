## New Feature Requests

### **Quick Settings Navigation** - **Status: Done**
- **Shift + Enter** on selected plugin to navigate directly to its Settings page
- **Technical Approach**: Detect "Settings" links in plugin row actions during data collection
- **Fallback Strategy**: For plugins without settings links, show notification "No settings page found"
- **User Experience**: Seamless navigation from search → settings without manual clicking
- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium (requires settings link detection and URL extraction)

Looking at your Plugin Quick Search code, I can identify several performance bottlenecks that are causing the laggy typing experience:

## Main Performance Issues

### 1. **Inefficient Levenshtein Distance Calculation**
The biggest culprit is the Levenshtein distance algorithm running on **every plugin** for **every keystroke**. This creates a quadratic time complexity problem:
- For each character typed, it runs on all plugins
- The algorithm itself is O(m×n) where m and n are string lengths
- With 500+ plugins, this becomes exponentially expensive

**Fix:** Only run fuzzy matching as a fallback when exact/partial matches are insufficient.

### 2. **Excessive DOM Manipulation**
Even with the "optimized" approach, you're still rebuilding the entire results HTML on every keystroke:
- String concatenation in a loop
- Full innerHTML replacement
- Re-applying event handlers

**Fix:** Implement virtual scrolling or result recycling - only update changed items.

### 3. **Redundant Search Operations**
The debouncing helps, but the search algorithm still does unnecessary work:
- Recalculating scores for plugins that haven't changed position significantly
- Re-sorting the entire array every time
- Processing plugins that clearly won't match

**Fix:** Implement incremental search - when adding characters, filter from previous results instead of starting fresh.

### 4. **Memory Allocation Overhead**
Creating new objects and arrays constantly:
```javascript
const scoredPlugins = matchingPlugins.map(plugin => ({
    ...plugin,
    score: calculateRelevanceScore(plugin, lowerQuery)
}));
```

**Fix:** Reuse objects and use in-place sorting with a separate scores array.

## Recommended Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
1. **Increase debounce delay** to 250-300ms (typing feel vs responsiveness trade-off) - **Status: Done**
2. **Lazy fuzzy matching** - only run Levenshtein when simple string matching yields <5 results - **Status: Done**
3. **Early result limiting** - stop processing after finding 20 good matches - **Status: Done**

### Phase 2: Algorithmic Improvements
1. **Incremental filtering** - when query gets longer, filter from previous results - **Status: Done**
2. **Tiered search strategy**: - **Status: Done**
   - First pass: exact matches only
   - Second pass: prefix matches
   - Third pass: contains matches
   - Final pass: fuzzy matching (only if needed)

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations

1. **Virtual scrolling** for the results list
   - **What it is**: Only renders visible items in the DOM, creating/destroying elements as user scrolls
   - **Benefits**: Handles thousands of plugins without performance degradation
   - **Implementation**: Track scroll position, calculate visible range, render only those items
   - **Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High) - Requires careful math for positioning, scroll event handling, and DOM management
   - **When needed**: 500+ plugins or noticeable scroll lag

2. **Web Workers** for fuzzy matching calculations
   - **What it is**: Move search/scoring calculations to background thread to avoid blocking UI
   - **Benefits**: Keeps interface responsive during complex search operations
   - **Implementation**: Transfer plugin data to worker, perform matching, return scored results
   - **Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium-High) - Worker setup, data serialization, async communication patterns
   - **When needed**: Search takes >50ms or causes UI freezing

3. **Trie data structure** for prefix matching
   - **What it is**: Tree structure where each node represents a character, enabling ultra-fast prefix searches
   - **Benefits**: O(m) search time where m = query length, regardless of dataset size
   - **Implementation**: Build trie from plugin names, traverse nodes for prefix matches
   - **Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High) - Complex data structure, memory management, Unicode handling
   - **When needed**: 1000+ plugins or prefix search is primary use case

4. **Result recycling** instead of full DOM rebuilds
   - **What it is**: Reuse existing DOM elements by updating content instead of destroying/creating
   - **Benefits**: Reduces garbage collection, maintains scroll position, smoother animations
   - **Implementation**: Pool of result elements, update text/attributes instead of innerHTML
   - **Complexity**: ⭐⭐ (Medium) - Element pooling logic, state management, event handler persistence
   - **When needed**: Frequent searches cause visible DOM rebuilding lag

   Augment assessment: PSR4 is still not needed even with all 4 optimizations.

## Expected Performance Impact
- **Current**: ~200-500ms lag on large plugin lists
- **After Phase 1**: ~50-100ms lag
- **After Phase 2**: ~20-50ms lag  
- **After Phase 3**: <20ms lag (near-instant)

The most impactful change would be eliminating the per-keystroke Levenshtein calculations and implementing smarter result filtering. This alone should make it feel significantly more responsive.
